I finished modeling the entire board in blender today, so here are a few different views of the clock\:

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="800" caption="Back of the board (sorry the board->board connector is blacked out..the lighting sucks)"].. image:: /images/clock_back.jpg

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="800" caption="Front of the board without the case of display modules"].. image:: /images/clock_front_nocase.jpg

I created these images in blender by exporting images of the various pcb layers from eagle, compositing them in gimp into front and back images, and uv-ing then onto the board. All the components were done by looking at their datasheets of course.
