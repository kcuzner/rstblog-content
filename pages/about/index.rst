 Me a decade ago[/caption]

My name is Kevin Cuzner. I'm an electrical engineer working in the Austin, TX area. This is my own personal technical blog  where I document my projects and experiments that I do as hobby projects. My interests range from embedded systems to 3D printing and pretty much anything I do that I feel like sharing will appear here.

Everything you see here will be developed primary on Linux using mostly free and/or open source software, but I make an effort to try to making things able to be compiled on Windows with appropriate tools installed and some (hopefully minimal) finagling. I prefer Arch Linux with the i3 window manager with a mixture of GTK and Qt programs. The server hosting this website is from AWS running their own Linux flavor.
