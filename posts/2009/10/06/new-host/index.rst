Thanks to my friend `Walter Zarnoch <http://www.zarnochwf1.com>`_, I now have a hosting plan that will work for the next two years while I am gone on a mission for my church. The plan is to basically keep my site up here while I am gone, hopefully getting hits and such from people interested in the crap on here, and then work on it after I get back. As for the future, I might keep this arrangement, but for all I know I might find out about a better arrangement later. Right now we share a hosting plan, splitting the cost 50/50, so its really not too bad at all costwise for a site I won't really be touching for two years.

Anyway, hopefully this works out...and I am sure glad to be off my grandma's website's host.
