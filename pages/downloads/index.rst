Recently I have become converted to github and with the release of github for Windows, I think it is safe to say I will most likely end up posting everything there.

My github\:Â `https\://github.com/kcuzner/ <https://github.com/kcuzner/>`_

On there I have my python websocket server, the LED CPU monitor (software and schematics) and a couple smaller projects. I won't be putting the dot matrix clock up there since it didn't quite work as planned and the schematic is incorrect. I wouldn't want anyone wasting money on something that won't actually work very well in the end.
