I have finally placed my order for the dot matrix clock. I chose revision 3.5 which had a surface mount crystal instead of the through hole version.

The only problem I have run into so far is that Olimex requires that the payment informatoin be faxed, so I have to use the fax machine at work to fax the order information. Luckily, my dad also works there and if he uses it for personal use there is much less chance of him being punished than me.

I just have to hope that they notice that all my solder side stuff is mirrored as that is the default with Eagle.
