Hi, I'm Kevin! I'm a hardware engineer working in the Austin, TX area. This is
my own personal technical blog where I document my experiments and projects
which I do as a hobby. My interests range from mixed signal electronics to 3D
printing and pretty much anything that I do outside of work that I feel like
sharing will appear here.

Most all of my projects are developed primarily on Linux using mostly free
and/or open-source software. I make efforts to allow things to be compiled on
windows, so if there's a project that doesn't compile will for you on windows,
please let me know.

My linux setup consists of `Arch Linux`_  with the `i3`_ window manager. I'm a
`vim`_ guy. This website runs on AWS using a `blog of my own design`_.
